about_me_description: My name is Hidvégi Anna, I’m a software developer from Hungary. I have 6 years of experience with Java backend development and 1.5 years as a Unity developer.<br>Apart from my day job I work on personal projects, like trying out new technologies, creating games and art or just having fun with a new tool. Although these projects are usually abandoned after a while I always learn a lot from them, making my knowledge both wider and deeper.<br>My dream is to work in a small indie game development studio where I can use all of my skills together. My other great interest is in visual storytelling (writing and drawing comics) and I would like to pursue this more seriously in the future.<br>I’m somewhat involved in social activism, especially in projects concerning the LGBTQ+ community.<br><a href="https://solanna7.github.io/sfg-site-2/">My personal projects site can be found here.</a>
